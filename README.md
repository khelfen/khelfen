# Hi there 👋

I'm Kilian – an energy systems engineer with a passion for open-source software, data-driven planning, and electric grids.

🏗️ At the Reiner Lemoine Institute, I work on scientific analyses of electricity networks across the **distribution and transmission grid** levels. My focus lies in modeling, scenario analysis and the integration of flexibility – all with the goal of supporting a reliable and sustainable energy transition.

🌍 I believe in evidence-based, collaborative approaches to tackle the energy transition – with real impact.

## 🔧 What I work on

- **[eGon-data](https://github.com/openego/eGon-data)**: Open data platform for integrated energy system modeling in Germany – I'm part of the core development team and responsible for integrating mobility, storage and grid data into a consistent network model.
- **[eDisGo](https://github.com/openego/eDisGo)**: Python-based tool for simulating and analyzing distribution grids, especially in the context of flexibility and sector coupling.
