# Hi there 👋

I'm Kilian, an energy systems engineer working on electricity grids, flexibility, and data-driven energy system analysis.

⚡ I currently work at **50Hertz Transmission GmbH**, in the area of voltage control and ancillary services. My work focuses on concepts, analyses, and tools related to voltage stability, grid operation, and ancillary services in the transmission system.

Due to the nature of my role, I am presently not actively contributing to open-source projects. That said, I remain interested in technical exchange and am generally open to research-oriented inquiries or collaborations. Feel free to reach out.

🌍 I care deeply about evidence-based approaches to the energy transition and about translating complex system analyses into decisions with real-world impact.

## 🔧 Previous work (open source & research)

Before joining 50Hertz, I worked as a research associate at the **Reiner Lemoine Institut**, focusing on scientific analyses of electricity networks across distribution and transmission grid levels. My work centered on modeling, scenario analysis, and the integration of flexibility options such as electric vehicles and storage.

Key projects I contributed to include:

- **[eGon-data](https://github.com/openego/eGon-data)**  
  Open data platform for integrated energy system modeling in Germany.  
  Core development work, with responsibility for integrating mobility, storage, and grid data into a consistent network model.

- **[eDisGo](https://github.com/openego/eDisGo)**  
  Python-based tool for simulating and analyzing distribution grids, particularly in the context of flexibility and sector coupling.

These projects reflect my past focus on open-source, reproducible research and collaborative tool development in the energy domain.
